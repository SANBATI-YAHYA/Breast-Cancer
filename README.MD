## Purpose

This project aims to analyze breast cancer data to:

- Understand patterns and trends in incidence and mortality.
- Develop predictive models using SVM classification.
- Present data insights using interactive Power BI visualizations.

---

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Power BI for visualization.
- Python (with libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib) for machine learning.

### Instructions

1. Navigate to the `Data/` directory to access raw datasets.
2. Review the analysis results in the `Raport/` directory.
3. Explore the machine learning model in `model classification svm Cancer/` for implementation details.

## Conclusion

This project effectively combines machine learning techniques with robust data visualization to address critical questions related to breast cancer. The SVM model is instrumental in predicting cancer likelihood based on cellular characteristics, while the Power BI analysis provides a demographic overview and highlights key patterns. Together, these methodologies offer a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing breast cancer data.
